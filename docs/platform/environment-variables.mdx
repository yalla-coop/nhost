Environment Variables are key-value pairs used to store configuration settings and parameters, influencing the behavior and settings of your services at runtime.


Here is how you would access an environment variable, `MY_NHOST_CONFIG`, from a function:

```ts functions/print-env.ts
import { Request, Response } from 'express'

export default (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  res.status(200).send(`${process.env.MY_NHOST_CONFIG} ${req.query.name}!`)
}
```

<Note>
Variables created are available to all services, including Run Services and Functions
